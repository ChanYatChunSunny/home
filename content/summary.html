<div class="marquee large-bold-text-outline">Hello, World!</div>
<p>I am <b>Chan Yat Chun</b> (you can also call me <b>Sunny</b>🌞), a Hong Kong programmer still studying. Welcome to my personal website!</p>
<p>I am currently a year three student studying at <b>Dept of Computing, HK PolyU</b>.</p>
<p>This website would show you some facts about my programming life. I hope you could understand more about me through this website.</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look around here, you can click the buttons on the left side to view more details about me! :)</p>

My favourite concept is
<br />
<br />
<div class="black-bg-green-text">
"<b>No physical system can have infinite memory, but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.</b>"
</div>
<br />
as it also represented the potential of many aspects in our lives (especially in programming) when certain phyiscal constraints can be ignored or neglected.
<br />
<br />
<b>Hopefully, you and I could break our constraints one day as well! :)</b>
