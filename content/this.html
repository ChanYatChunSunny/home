<h1>Behind this website</h1>
<hr />
This website was made using HTML, JS, and CSS, without any WYSIWYG editor. Online guides and tools such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> were being used during the process of development. Visual Studio with IntelliSense is also being used.
<br />
<br />
jQuery (3.7.1) is being used so that the JS code can be a bit cleaner.
