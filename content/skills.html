<h1>My personal skills</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Concept abstraction</h2>
<p>The physical storage size of my brain is finite, so my memory is also finite, just like everyone else. However, I am capable of efficiently abstracting complicated topics into sequences of smaller concepts and focus on the important parts of them instead of attempting to remember everything word by word. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Project digestion with top-down approach</h2>
<p>When working on a programming project, I always love to recursively divide the bigger tasks into multiple smaller tasks. I believe that this approach can help me understand my progress more Intuitively while also incerease the maintainability and readability of my code.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Analogy with daily life for simplification</h2>
<p>A concept is too hard to understand? In fact, most computer science concepts are relevant to real life. After all, computers were created by humans that also live in our reality! During explantation of some complex concepts, I personally would use real life example to assist me. For example, the inheritance concept of OOP can be explained by something like "object->food->fruit->orange".</p>
<p>I also always take inspiration from my daily life when I am programming. For example, a school project had required me to develop a library mangament system, so I took some inspiration from the system my university's library is using.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Logical thinking</h2>
<p>I am able to intuitively understand what sequence of logics is required to form a given result. My speed of turning a statement in casual human language into series of rigid logical statements is also faster than average among my peers.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Potential issues and worst case outcome prediction</h2>
<p>While it is great to be optimistic to stay positive, it is also important to consider what would happen in worst case when working for a programming project. I am known to be good at predicting bad outcomes during the planning phase of a project before the issues arise.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Requirements outlining for project planning</h2>
<p>I am capable to outline and predict most of the the required steps and tools before the beginning of every project. This could greatly avoid spending additional time to find things that are needed during the project.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Mild perfectionism in optimization</h2>
<p>I beleive that when it doable and reasonable, my code should be optimized to the best possible performance.</p>
