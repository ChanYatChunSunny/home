The repo to show my info

This website was made using HTML, JS, and CSS, without any WYSIWYG editor. Online guides and tools such as W3Schools were being used during the process of development. Visual Studio with IntelliSense is also being used.

jQuery (3.7.1) is being used so that the JS code can be a bit cleaner.
