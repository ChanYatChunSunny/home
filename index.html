            <p>I am <b>Chan Yat Chun</b> (you can also call me <b>Sunny</b>🌞), a Hong Kong programmer still studying. Welcome to my personal website!</p>
            <p>I am currently a year three student studying at <b>Dept of Computing, HK PolyU</b>.</p>
            <p>This website would show you some facts about my programming life. I hope you could understand more about me through this website.</p>
            <p>Feel free to take a look around here, you can click the buttons on the left side to view more details about me! :)</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            My favourite concept is
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="black-bg-green-text">
                "<b>No physical system can have infinite memory, but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing-complete.</b>"
            </div>
            <br />
            as it also represented the potential of many aspects in our lives (especially in programming) when certain phyiscal constraints can be ignored or neglected.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Hopefully, you and I could break our constraints one day as well! :)</b>
        </div>
